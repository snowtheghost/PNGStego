On the surface, HiddenFeelings is a collection of abstract images created using digital media. The art in the collection reflects an array of human emotions that may be difficult to reach and see. Similarly to human emotions, you may have already found that these images hold more information than what is visually available to you - perhaps that may be how you found this note. Nevertheless, we are confident that you will find what you're looking for, whether it be in art, or within yourself.

We created the HiddenFeelings project to introduce the limitless potential of digital media. This collection primarily utilizes the technique of steganography, which is being used to form the art that can be seen, alongside the art that cannot yet be seen. As you would expect, each piece of the collection consists of a visible image and a hidden component encoded in that image. Some of these images will be easy to search while others will take a great deal of skill, knowledge, and dedication to break. Some of these images may have obvious signs that something is being hidden, others may not.

The techniques being used to create this form of digital art renders lossy copies of the artworks useless, as every pixel of the image holds significance. Compression of the image, although maintaining the visual form of the image, will destroy the hidden component of any piece in the collection. It follows that you, the owner of the image, hold great responsibility in keeping the original image secure, as the hidden art cannot be retrieved once the original is out of circulation.

Once you own a piece of our collection, what you do with it is entirely up to you. We encourage you to discuss the artwork and work with others to break the image. There will always be a connection between what you see and what you find, but how you interpret this connection is yours and yours only.
